<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Zach, I'm a 21 year old aspiring web developer. I have just started learning html, css, and javascript.<br>
My whole life I have always been heavily involved with the internet, I can recall a specific time in elementary school <br>
when I discovered "inspect element" on the web browser, I played around with it and my friends thought I was a magician.<br>
At the time, I didn't know that I was working with html, but now I can look back on that moment and it makes me think that<br>
I have always sort of been interested in web development.
